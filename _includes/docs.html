                    <p class="text-muted text-justify">Now it's time to upload your coverage reports. We currently support Cobertura reports, an XML file format. Almost all programming languages have tools to generate Cobertura reports. Oh, and here's a sample <code>curl</code> command to run after your tests have generated the Cobertura report.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted text-justify"><code>JOB_NAME</code>: The name of the job or build. Your project may produce more than one coverage report, for example for one for Python 2.7, one for Python 3.4, and one for Javascript. The job names could then be <code>py27</code>, <code>py35</code> and <code>js</code> but it's really up to you.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justify"><code>COVERAGE_FILE</code>: The coverage report generated by your test suite, in the Cobertura file format.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justify"><code>REPO_OWNER</code>, <code>REPO_NAME</code>: The owner and name of the enabled repository.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justify"><code>COMMIT</code>: The commit that triggered the build.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justify"><code>PULL_REQUEST</code>: If the pull request number is provided then Couverture will generate a differential coverage report and publish it on the pull request. Otherwise it is assumed that the commit was pushed outside of the context of a pull request (e.g. direct commit to master) and Couverture will save the coverage report for this commit in case a pull request is opened against it.</p>

                    <h4>Differential coverage reports</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justify">Now there's really nothing else to do but to wait for Couverture to generate and publish a differential coverage report to your pull request. The coverage report status will either be <code>SUCCEEDED</code> or <code>FAILED</code> and the commit status of your pull request will be reflected appropriately. There are two possible reason in case of failure: 1) the coverage has dropped or 2) coverage has improved but not all code changes are covered.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justify">Your report may warn you that the base coverage was not found. This means that no coverage reports was uploaded for the branch you are trying to merge into and may cause the differential report to not display some coverage changes.</p>
